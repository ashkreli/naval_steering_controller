# Naval Steering Controller Project
## Arba Shkreli, Ezenia Diaz-Lembert, Eric Shi, Matthias Fischer

As our final project in ES 155: Systems and Control, we designed a controller for a naval
steering system that outputs the needed engine torque to achieve a desired position/velocity. 
The general workflow is what theoretically control engineers would undergo. `Final Report.pdf` 
describes the work in detail. The corresponding code is available upon request.
